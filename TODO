1. Add atom (using reductions): Quantile([f_i(x) <= 0, ...], fraction)
	a. Replace this atom with variable t.
	b. Add chance constraint a_i^Tx - b <= t for fraction i's.
	Note: Only works for convex inequality constraints f_i(x) <= 0.

2. Look up references for a paper in Optima/Optimization Letters. 
   This technique is a special case of majorization-minimization on 
   constraints with only 2 steps.
